I am a third year PhD in the School of Industrial Engineering specializing in machine learning and artificial intelligence at Purdue Univesity advised by [Dr. Vaneet Aggarwal] (https://www.linkedin.com/in/vaneet-aggarwal-12060952/). 
I received my Bachelorâ€™s and Master's degree in Electrical Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur in 2019. I was advised by [Dr. Ketan Rajawat](https://home.iitk.ac.in/~ketan/) at IIT Kanpur.
Prior to joining Purdue, I worked for an year and half as a Quantitative Developer at JP Morgan Chase & Co. 
At JPMChase, I was part of the Wholesale Credit portfolio model implementation team, and my work was focused on development of statistical loss forecasting models for CRE, CMBS Loan portfolios.


Research Interests
======
My research interests are broadly aligned with **Federated Learning**, **Distributed Machine Learning**, **Reinforcement Learning**, **Quantum Machine Learning**.  
One of the key themes of my PhD research is towards developing efficient Federated Learning architectures for settings where clients experience cross-network data heterogeneity 
as well as time-varying drifts in data distributions. I am also deeply interested in both theoretical aspects and application problems of Reinforcement Learning. 
My prior works in RL establishes new platforms in **distributed training** scenarios. Recently, I have started exploring Quantum ML wherein I am specifically investigating how
quantum statistical techniques could be leveraged to obtain ML model training speed-ups over their classical counterparts.
